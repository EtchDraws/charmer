What I will and won't draw:\n\nNo NSFW, fetishes, or sexual themes\n\nNo mechas\n\nNo large group drawings (max 4 characters)\n\nNo overly complicated outfits/designs (ask me if you're unsure)\n\nNo drug usage.\n\nNo copyrighted characters, fan characters ok.\n\nNo gore (some blood is okay.)\n\nWill draw furries, humans, humanoids, ferals, etc. (Furries/anthros preferred.) Weed and alcohol use is not okay.\n\nReferences\n\nI must be provided with a reference image of your character. Depending on the type of art, there will be different requirements for how much of the body must be shown in the reference image. (ex. fullbody comm must provide fullbody reference.) Please have a flat color reference sheet/image. If your reference is traditional art, then you must provide HEX codes of each color of your character. If your reference image doesn't show the eye/pawpads/tongue color but it needs to be drawn in the commission, then please provide a HEX code for that color.\n\nPayments\n\nAll commissions will be paid via Paypal in full up-front. My prices are in USD.\n\nYour commission will not be started or added to the queue until the invoice has been paid. If the invoice isn't paid after 2 days of receiving the invoice, your commission will be canceled.\n\nI will not lower my prices for any reason.\n\nI will not do payment plans.\n\nI will not accept partial payments or payment after sketch or full completion.\n\nCommissioner and Artist Rights\n\nI reserve full copyright to all commissioned work. I may repost your commission to my social media pages, show it on my site and other places, unless otherwise agreed upon. I will credit your character/username. I will not sell any merchandise with your commissioned art on it. You reserve the rights to your original character. You have the right to repost your commission to your pages (with credit to me). You may use your commission for any personal non-commerical/profit purposes. You may not use my artwork for profit.\n\nRevision and Edit Policy\n\nI will always send a sketch of your commission and wait for your approval before continuing on it. At this stage, please request any changes that you'd like. After the lineart has been started/completed, I will not make any major edits (species change, pose, gender, hair, clothing, expression, etc.)\n\nI will complete the commission with your requested changes (if any) and send you the .png file when complete.\n\nYou may request edits to your commission if I made a mistake on it. Any mistakes that are the fault of your reference image/sheet will not be changed. Please make sure your reference is clear.\n\nYou may request edits to your commission for a fee.\n\nI will NOT edit the character's species at any time.\n\nOther Important Notes\n\nYou may not remove my signature/watermark in any way. Whether you edit it out, cover it, or crop it out, it is strictly prohibited.\n\nPlease be patient with me and understand that I am NOT a full-time artist, and that I am also a student. This means that I may not always be able to reply to your message right away, but I will always try my best to get back to you on the same day. It is NOT guaranteed that I will complete a commission that I meant for as gift before a specific date. More on that below. I will accept rush commissions however it will cost you a fee depending on how fast it needs to be complete. I'm not likely to accept a rush of any less than 2 days. I do not work on deadlines unless it is a rush commission..",
